To make it fun as the original, we keep as much as possible by:
  - "mirror" mechanics from the past
  - could use some polishing but underneath stuff should feel the same
  - fixes previous issues

## Mirroring Mechanics

### Peace Deals

**Old**: Game determined war duration
**New**: Apply large penalty on war exhaustion, forcing player & AI to end the war
  - fix reunification length problem: war exhaustion depends on if enemy is a
    "core" rival or foreign & other civ modifiers

## Tax Efficiencies

**Old**: land size penalty + terrain mask + distance
**New**: population dispersion (capital vs. COG pop) + terrain mask + distance
